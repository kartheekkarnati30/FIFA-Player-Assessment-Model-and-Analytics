## EDA on player age, wage and value 
```{r}

## Correlation amongst age, wage and value with age threshold 28:
```{r}

  print(paste("Year", years[[i]], ":", "Player age <= 28"))

  print(round(cor_over28, 2))
  #age is negatively correlated with both wage and value but the correlation is
  #almost negligable b/w the age and wage pair over the years.
  #Also wage and value are highly +vely correlated.

## Difference in heading abilities for pllayers based on aerial threat tag:

#Clubs with the most aerial threats:

## Difference in shooting ability for pllayers based on fk specialist tag:
```{r}
tidy_fifa20_bigrams %>% filter(bigram=="fk specialist") %>%
  summarise(avg_shooting = mean(shooting))
#avg shooting 78
tidy_fifa20_bigrams %>% filter(bigram!="fk specialist") %>%

tidy_fifa20_bigrams %>% filter(bigram=="fk specialist") %>%

#Juventus, PSG and Real Madrid.
```
## Difference in finishing ability for pllayers based on clinical finisher tag:
```{r}

tidy_fifa20_bigrams %>% filter(bigram=="clinical finisher") %>%
  summarise(avg_finishing = mean(attacking_finishing))
#avg finishing 88.5
tidy_fifa20_bigrams %>% filter(bigram!="clinical finisher") %>%
