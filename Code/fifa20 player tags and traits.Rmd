## Misc. EDA

```

## EDA on player age, wage and value 
```{r}

for (i in seq_along(fifa_datasets_list))
{
  wage_plot <- fifa_datasets_list[[i]] %>% ggplot(aes(age, wage_eur))+geom_point()+
    geom_jitter()+labs(x="player age", y="player wage in euros per week",
                       title = "wage vs age plot")
  print(wage_plot)
  
  value_plot <- fifa_datasets_list[[i]] %>% ggplot(aes(age, value_eur))+geom_point()+
    geom_jitter()+labs(x="player age", y="player value in euros",
                       title = "value vs age plot")
  print(value_plot)
  
}
```


## Correlation amongst age, wage and value with age threshold 28:
```{r}
for (i in seq_along(fifa_datasets_list))
{
  players28_andless <- fifa_datasets_list[[i]] %>% 
    filter(age <= 28)%>% select(age, wage_eur, value_eur)
  players_over28 <- fifa_datasets_list[[i]] %>% 
    filter(age > 28)%>% select(age, wage_eur, value_eur)
  
  cor_28andless <- cor(players28_andless)
  print(paste("Year", years[[i]], ":", "Player age <= 28"))
  print(round(cor_28andless, 2))
  #age is positively correlated with both wage and value.
  #Also wage and value are highly +vely correlated.

  cor_over28 <- cor(players_over28)
  print(paste("Year", years[[i]], ":", "Player age > 28"))
  print(round(cor_over28, 2))
  #age is negatively correlated with both wage and value but the correlation is
  #almost negligable b/w the age and wage pair over the years.
  #Also wage and value are highly +vely correlated.

## Player tags analysis:

## Difference in heading abilities for pllayers based on aerial threat tag:
```{r}
aerial_threats <- tidy_fifa20_bigrams %>% filter(bigram == "aerial threat")
not_aerial_threats <- tidy_fifa20_bigrams %>% filter(bigram != "aerial threat")

aerial_threats %>% summarise(avg_heading = mean(attacking_heading_accuracy))
#avg heading of 80
not_aerial_threats %>% summarise(avg_heading = mean(attacking_heading_accuracy))
#avg heading of 67.1

#Clubs with the most aerial threats:
tidy_fifa20_bigrams %>% filter(bigram=="aerial threat") %>%
  count(club) %>% arrange(desc(n))

```

## Difference in shooting ability for pllayers based on fk specialist tag:
```{r}
tidy_fifa20_bigrams %>% filter(bigram=="fk specialist") %>%
  summarise(avg_shooting = mean(shooting))
#avg shooting 78
tidy_fifa20_bigrams %>% filter(bigram!="fk specialist") %>%
  summarise(avg_shooting = mean(shooting))
#avg shooting 68


##Clubs with the most fk specialists or clubs mostly likely to get a goal via a fk:
tidy_fifa20_bigrams %>% filter(bigram=="fk specialist") %>%
  count(club) %>% arrange(desc(n))
#Juventus, PSG and Real Madrid.
```
## Difference in finishing ability for pllayers based on clinical finisher tag:
```{r}

tidy_fifa20_bigrams %>% filter(bigram=="clinical finisher") %>%
  summarise(avg_finishing = mean(attacking_finishing))
#avg finishing 88.5
tidy_fifa20_bigrams %>% filter(bigram!="clinical finisher") %>%

#Clubs with the most clinical finishers:
tidy_fifa20_bigrams %>% filter(bigram=="clinical finisher") %>%

#FC Barcelona
```

## Player traits analysis:
```{r}
player_traits <- fi20 %>% separate_rows(player_traits, convert = TRUE, sep = ", ")
View(player_traits)

#Most common player traits:
player_traits %>% filter(player_traits != "") %>%

#clubs with most crowd favs:
player_traits %>% filter(player_traits != "") %>% 
  filter(player_traits == "Crowd Favourite")%>%
  count(club, player_traits) %>% arrange(desc(n))
#Man Utd and Man City.

#clubs with players who argue with officials the most:
player_traits %>% filter(player_traits != "") %>% 
  filter(player_traits == "Argues with Officials")%>%
  count(club, player_traits) %>% arrange(desc(n))
#Juventus, Napoli, Dortmund and Bayern Munich.


#Clubs with the most selfish players:
player_traits %>% filter(player_traits != "") %>% 
  filter(player_traits == "Selfish")%>%
  count(club, player_traits) %>% arrange(desc(n))
#Ajax, man utd and city, PSG.
#Do clubs with most selfish players have high wage bills?
fi20 %>% group_by(club)%>% 
  summarise(sum_wage = sum(wage_eur)) %>% arrange(desc(sum_wage))
#Man City, Man Utd and PSG are among the top 10 clubs who have the highest wage bill 
#per week


#Clubs with the most injury prone players:
player_traits %>% filter(player_traits != "") %>% 
  filter(player_traits == "Injury Prone")%>%
  count(club, player_traits) %>% arrange(desc(n))
#Man Utd
#Since Man Utd is in the top 10 clubs with highest weekly wage bills, they tend to
#lose alot of money to players who dont play much due to injuries.

#Clubs with the most leaders:
player_traits %>% filter(player_traits != "") %>% 
  filter(player_traits == "Leadership")%>%
  count(club, player_traits) %>% arrange(desc(n))
#KAA Gent, Man Utd and Eibar.

#Clubs with the most divers:
player_traits %>% filter(player_traits != "") %>% 
  filter(player_traits == "Diver")%>%
  count(club, player_traits) %>% arrange(desc(n))
#Sheffield United and Vitesse

#clubs with most dribblers:Speed Dribbler (CPU AI Only)
player_traits %>% filter(player_traits != "") %>% 
  filter(player_traits == "Speed Dribbler (CPU AI Only)")%>%
  count(club, player_traits) %>% arrange(desc(n))
#PSV and FC Twente

#clubs with most injury free players:

#FC Zurich, Levante, Querataro and Sunderland
