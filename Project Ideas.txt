--Highest rated player with each jersey number
Player rating progression over the years for select clubs
EDA on body type, work rate, player tags and player traits
--EDA on age/salary, age/value, best 11s over and under 23yrs of age
--EDA on wages, salary and release clause
--Fastest player, best shooter, best passer, best dribbler, best defender and the strongest player
--Players with the highest potential rating
--Tall players are good at heading, short players are good at dribbling and strong people are good at tackling
Player traits and tags
--best player for each country (top 10 FIFA ranked countries) for each year
--Goalkeepers with the best diving and reflexes

ML Ideas:
Classify player position based on physical attributes (height, weight, age, strength, speed, jump...).
Classify player nationality based on “style of play” attributes like shooting, passing, dribbling, defending, pace… (Spain expected to have high numbers for passing?)
Predict player rating
Predict player value
Classify prefered foot 
Classify work rates
